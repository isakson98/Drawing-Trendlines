why work on a brand new project if this is already a good, documented base?

Mindset: After the initial time investment, adding and analyzing new features should be the main goal 

CATEGORIES of improvements

design improvements
- refactor code to be more efficient and have less boilerplate
- utilize apache airflow
- use relational db
- make transition between local and cloud more seamless
- have the ability to easily get new features and retrain
- have the ability to pull new data
- have the ability to make realtime decisions
- have better visualizations
- make it compatible with crypto

trendline improvement:
- clean up trendline that do not touch any price 


feature improvements:
- price features
-- raw price features -> independent of the setup 
    -- pct increase
    -- candle count
    -- volume
    -- gap-up on day of entry?
    -- day of entry day green/red? / how green?
    -- was the breakout day also a 5 day high? a day 10 high? -> however, would need to modify label as well
-- technical indicators -> independent of the setup 
    -- rsi
    -- macd
    -- Stochastic Oscillator 
    -- emas (ma slope, ma envelope, # of ma reclaims, prices touches, or how much time spent above/below it for each )
    -- emas pt2. (lowest ema that captures the bodies of the most candles at the low)
-- setup features -> depends on the setup (pole/flag ratio, slopes, etc)
-- market features 
    -- relative strength to spy + to its sector (in more than just price, perhaps relative strength as well normalized)
    -- relative strength of its sector to spy (+ to other sectors )
    -- market breadth
- fundies features -> include sector hot-encoding, q/q, y/y, eps, revenue
- alternative features (sentiment, interest rates, etc, seasonality, volatility)
NOTE:
- does the calculation include the day of the entry or no? (i.e. make sure features do not interfere with labels)


label improvements:
- labels should be independent from features -> it just needs to know the entry price
- define entry on start, is entry as soon as it breaks or EOD
- introduce time limit
- play around with stop loss
- introduce distinction between good and great setups
- increase r/r 
- make profits several stage (sell at condition #1, sell at condition #2)
- allow
